# Pneumonia
Pneumonia Diagnostic Aid - AI Project


build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. I build a classification system that

Can help flag serious cases
Quickly identify healthy cases
And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

_______________________________________________________________________________
1- build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product.


2-build four models using Google Cloud AutoML with four different variations on a medical imaging dataset. You'll have the opportunity to observe how properties of the data impact the models' results. To submit the project, fill out the AutoML Modeling Report and include screenshots of your models' results.
